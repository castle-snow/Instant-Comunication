# Instant-Comunication
We built this repository on Dec 9 2016, and start our work on building a web chat application.
The application consists of the front end and the back-end site. The core of the back-end will be developed by java. And the DB part will be developed by PHP.
The server will use Linux as operating system. Apache will be installed as web server, and also Mysql to provide data persistence.
